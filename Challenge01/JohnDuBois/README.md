To run the Scheme code, you will need a Scheme interpreter.  A nice one is available
online at http://repl.it/languages/Scheme/

In Scheme, the source data is constructed with a n-tuple like (list "a1" "b2")
The code can be run on your source data by invoking the code-challenge-one function like:
(code-challenge-one (list "a1" "b2"))
